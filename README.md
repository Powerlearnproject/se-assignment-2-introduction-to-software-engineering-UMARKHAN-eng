Software Design Principles:

Software design principles are guidelines for crafting well-structured, maintainable software. Here are some core principles:

Single Responsibility (SRP): Each module should have a single, clear purpose for better organization and reduced complexity.
Open/Closed (OCP): Software should be open for extension (adding features) but closed for modification (avoiding code changes). This promotes flexibility and minimizes unintended effects.
Liskov Substitution (LSP): Subclasses should seamlessly replace their base classes without breaking the program. This ensures reliable and reusable code.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Modularity is a fundamental principle in software design. It involves dividing a program into independent, self-contained units called modules. Each module has a specific function and interacts with other modules through well-defined interfaces. Imagine constructing a house with prefabricated walls, floors, and electrical systems â€“ each a modular unit contributing to the overall structure.

Benefits of Modularity:

Enhanced Maintainability: Changes or bug fixes within a module have minimal impact on other parts of the system. This isolates issues and makes maintenance more efficient.
Improved Scalability: Adding new features or functionalities often involves creating new modules or modifying existing ones. Modular design facilitates scaling the system by easily integrating new modules without extensive code restructuring.
Promoted Reusability: Well-designed modules can be reused in different parts of the same program or even across different projects. This reduces development time and promotes code consistency.
Increased Understandability: Modular code is easier to comprehend and reason about. Each module has a clear purpose and limited dependencies, making the overall codebase more understandable.
